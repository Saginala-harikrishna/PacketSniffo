# PacketSniffo

PacketSniffo is a lightweight packet sniffer built with Python and Scapy.  
It captures network packets in real-time and provides visibility into protocols, source/destination addresses, and packet details.

# Project Goals

- Understand core networking concepts (OSI Layers 2–4, TCP/UDP/IP).
- Build a mini alternative to Wireshark for learning and demonstration.
- Incrementally add features (basic sniffing → filtering → protocol decoding → analysis).
